## Introduction

MMRazor is a model compression toolkit for model slimming and AutoML, which includes 3 mainstream technologies:

- Neural Architecture Search (NAS)
- Pruning
- Knowledge Distillation (KD)
- Quantization (come soon)

It is a part of the [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/) project.

Major features:

- **Compatibility**

  MMRazor can be easily applied to various projects in OpenMMLab, due to the similar architecture design of OpenMMLab as well as the decoupling of slimming algorithms and vision tasks.

- **Flexibility**

  Different algorithms, e.g., NAS, pruning and KD, can be incorporated in a plug-n-play manner to build a more powerful system.

- **Convenience**

  With better modular design, developers can implement new model compression algorithms with only a few codes, or even by simply modifying config files.

Below is an overview of MMRazor's design and implementation, please refer to [tutorials](https://mmrazor.readthedocs.io/en/dev-1.x/get_started/overview.html) for more details.

## Installation

MMRazor depends on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [MMCV](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv) and [MMEngine](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmengine).

Please refer to [installation.md](/docs/en/get_started/installation.md) for more detailed instruction.

## Getting Started

Please refer to [user guides](https://mmrazor.readthedocs.io/en/dev-1.x/user_guides/index.html) for the basic usage of MMRazor. There are also [advanced guides](https://mmrazor.readthedocs.io/en/dev-1.x/advanced_guides/index.html):

## Contributing

We appreciate all contributions to improve MMRazor.
Please refer to [CONTRUBUTING.md](/docs/en/notes/contribution_guide.md) for the contributing guideline.

## Acknowledgement

MMRazor is an open source project that is contributed by researchers and engineers from various colleges and companies. We appreciate all the contributors who implement their methods or add new features, as well as users who give valuable feedbacks.
We wish that the toolbox and benchmark could serve the growing research community by providing a flexible toolkit to reimplement existing methods and develop their own new model compression methods.
