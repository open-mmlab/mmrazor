## Prepare datasets

Currently our algorithms support [mmclassification](https://mmclassification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
[mmdetection](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and
[mmsegmentation](https://mmsegmentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Before running our algorithms, you may need to prepare the datasets according
to the instructions in the corresponding document.
